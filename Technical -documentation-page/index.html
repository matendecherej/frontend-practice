        <h1>Flats</h1>
        <p>These have to be my least favourite tyoe of shoe. Aside from being just flat, there is very little to work with. The most impressive ones I have come across are those ones that have a heel change, made by a certain american designer.</p>I have stumbled upon a few examples such as, Jelly, Loafers, Ballerina flats, Moccasins and slip ons. Of all these I find the most comfortable ones are the ballerina flats of which I have around 4 pairs that I habe worn once each. <p>I acknowledge how relevant and significant they are especially in carrying out day to day activities inthe office and such but I honestly dont plan on getting more.</p>

        <h1>Sneakers</h1>
        <p>These have to be the most convenient for me. Well, because first i have a big issue with cold feet and also i just love socks and walking around</p>There are a lot of good designs like converse, especially the ones upto the ankle. Additionally, I love the mens versions like the jordans or addidas or puma etc.<p>To be honest i have like 5 pairs of sneakers with most being worn nce in a while, I usuallly wear them when I am doing a house visit or an outdoor hang out but its not my cuo of tea. Overall I like how far sneakers for women have come.</p>

        <h1>Boots</h1>
        <p>Favorite type of shoes. Stylish and warm. Beautiful and there are so many designs i could work with Hallelujah!</p>I have around twenty pairs of these and i am definitely getting more and more and more<p>I am still looking for a grey pair a white pair and a snake skin pair. The beauty is, with my shoe size its easier to find these things.</p><p></p>

        <h1>Heels</h1>
        <p>As a shortperson i need to acknowledge that heels are my dream. I love heels and I will kill for them. I promise</p><p>I unfortunately have around 30 pairs and i dont consider them enough. There is more to discover in future i wpold like to own a closet solely for shoes.</p><p>All heels are my type however the low heels like an inch or two sound like an inconvenience just wear a statement shoe jeez!!</p>

        <h1>Sandals</h1>
        <p>Least favorite pair. Unfortunately I have just a pair. I see no difference between sandals and walking barefoot.</p><p>Another thing is I am not keen on the meintenance of my feet. The most I so i wash them oil them and put them in socks. Sandals will require a lot more.</p><p>There are good designs available but i dont know a lot about flats</p>
